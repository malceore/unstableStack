Make a Tricky Towers clone?
Need to build as high as possible, generates a score?
	Shapes could be randomly generated...
Will need physics that I don't believe hexi.js has..
Looks like we can possibly combine matterJS based on this issue
https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/issues/44

Let's try.
Maybe make it so the darker the tone the more dense the block?
	Can easily manipulate mass
Should make an object that combines a sprite with a body and
	changes tint based on mass given.
physicsSprite(x, y, width, height, mass);
Maybe make it control with mouse?
Get 7 blocks stacked and the eighth can be made static.
	Activated with shift?

Todo:
\- 1. Need a square and a button that spawns squares.
\- 2. Physics for the squares to stack on the platform.


Next we'll need an object for creating
Then we'll work on a few different tetris style pieces that inherit
Finally we'll get some horiviontial and vertical movement of' current block
	This will have to be done by moving the physics body.
