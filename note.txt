Make a Tricky Towers clone?
Need to build as high as possible, generates a score?
	Shapes could be randomly generated...
Will need physics that I don't believe hexi.js has..
Looks like we can possibly combine matterJS based on this issue
https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi/issues/44

Let's try.
Maybe make it so the darker the tone the more dense the block?
	Can easily manipulate mass
Should make an object that combines a sprite with a body and
	changes tint based on mass given.
physicsSprite(x, y, width, height, mass);
Maybe make it control with mouse?
Get 7 blocks stacked and the eighth can be made static.
	Activated with shift?

Todo:
\- Need a square and a button that spawns squares.
\- Physics for the squares to stack on the platform.
\- Next we'll need an object for creating
\- Then we'll work on a few different tetris style pieces that inherit

Fuck I'm stuck. MY pixi container is upper left pivot and Matterjs you
cannot change that or it changes the weight dist also..
Need to find a solution for this, fix physics so things stay together more, more stable.

Finally we'll get some horiviontial and vertical movement of' current block
	This will have to be done by moving the physics body.
After that we'll want the camera to track the center of the blocks
Next we'll make the choice menu that will give you two blocks to choose from.
Then we'll get a score going for each block.
Then we'll take blocks that are well off screen and make them static.
Then a combo meter that lets you place a static block.
Then we'll come back and polish the game, menu, clean up, new game, etc.
Then we'll come back and add graphics, challenges, story and context.
Don't forget about sound!
